% create a baseline model of the ERJ 175, long-range version (also known as
% an ERJ 170-200). this version uses a conventional propulsion
% architecture.
%
% all required inputs contain "** required **" before the description of
% the parameter to be specified. all other parameters may remain as NaN,
% and they will be filled in by a statistical regression. for improved
% accuracy, it is suggested to provide as many parameters as possible.
%
% inputs : none     
% outputs: Aircraft - aircraft data structure to be used for analysis.
