% Provide an example aircraft definition for the user. Here, the Embraer 
% E190-E2 is defined from "Advanced 2030 Single Aisle Aircraft Modeling for
% the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration Program", and is used for
% aircraft sizing/performance analysis.
%
% Anything with a "** REQUIRED **" is an input that the user must provde.
% All other inputs can remain NaN, and a regression function will fill in
% the missing data. The more data that can be provided in this function
% will yield a more realistically sized design.
%
% See AircraftSpecsPkg.README for a comprehensive review of building
% aircraft specification files
%
% INPUTS:
%     none
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - an aircraft structure to be used for analysis.
