% Simulate aircraft charging with desired charging time and power strategy.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft      - structure with information about the aircraft's mission
%                     history and battery SOC after flying.
%                     size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
%     ChrgTime      - available charging time on the ground 
%                     size/type/units: 1-by-1 / double / [s].
%
%     PowerStrategy - charging power input. This can be either:
%                     a scalar value or an array of charging power 
%                     values (which will be used with a dynamic
%                     battery charging way) for each time step.
%                     size/type/units: 1-by-1 / double & array / [W]
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft      - structure with updated mission history and charged battery
%                     parameters.
%                     size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []

%% A Dynamic Charging Power Strategy For Constant Power%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function outputs a dynamic charging power based on the different SOC.
% When the input is a scalar, the charging power is tapered as the battery
% approaches full charge (since 80% SOC).
function dynamicPower = DynamicChargePower(SOC, basePower)
    if SOC < 80
        dynamicPower = basePower;
    else
        dynamicPower = basePower * (100 - SOC) / 20;  % linearly taper to 0 as SOC nears 100%
    end
