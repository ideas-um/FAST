% Simulate aircraft charging at an airport gate.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft   - structure with information about the aircraft's mission
%                  history and battery SOC after flying.
%                  size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
%     GroundTime - available charging time on the ground.
%                  size/type/units: 1-by-1 / double / [s]
%
%     ChrgRate   - airport charging rate.
%                  size/type/units: 1-by-1 / double / [kW]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     SOCEnd     - state of charge after the ground turn.
%                  size/type/uints: 1-by-1 / double / [%]
