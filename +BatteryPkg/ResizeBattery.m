% After an aircraft flies a mission, update its battery size. If a "simple"
% battery model is used (not considering cells in series and parallel),
% then only the battery weight is updated based on the energy required 
% during the flight. If a "detailed" battery model is used (considers cells
% in series and parallel), the number of cells in the battery is also
% updated based on the final state of charge and the assumed maximum
% C-rate.

% INPUTS:

% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft structure with the updated battery weight and
%                number of cells in the battery.
