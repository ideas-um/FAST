%% FLIGHT CONDITION CALCULATIONS %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% get the flight conditions
Alt  = OffParams.FlightCon.Alt; 
Mach = OffParams.FlightCon.Mach;

% compute the true airspeed at altitude
[~, TAS] = MissionSegsPkg.ComputeFltCon(Alt, 0, "Mach", Mach);

% get the thrust required
ThrustReq = OffParams.Thrust;

% compute the thrust from the electric motor
T_EM = ElectricLoad * Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.Engine.EtaPoly.Fan / TAS;

% check that it is a number
if (isnan(T_EM))
    T_EM = 0;
end

% subtract the thrust provided by the electric motor
ThrustReq = ThrustReq - T_EM;

% negative thrust required indicates the electric motor produces all power
if (ThrustReq < -1.0e-06)
    
    % therefore, no thrust from the engine is needed
    ThrustReq = 0;
    
end

% convert to kN
ThrustReq = ThrustReq / 1000;

% The thrust_SLS_Conv (kN) is the designed thrust obtained by running 
% non-electrification case 
SLSThrust_conv = ( Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.SLSThrust(1) + Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.SLSThrust(3) ) / 1000;


%% FUEL FLOW CALCULATIONS %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% fuel flow rate coefficients of BADA equation
Cff3  =  Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.Engine.Cff3;
Cff2  =  Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.Engine.Cff2;
Cff1  =  Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.Engine.Cff1;
Cffch =  Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.Engine.Cffch;

% get the engine's SLS thrust (in kN)
% if there is no electrification in takeoff, it will run
% non-electrification case, which c = 1 (SLSThrust_HE = SLSThrust_Conv)
SLSThrust_HE = Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.SLSThrust(1) / 1000;
c = 2 - SLSThrust_HE / SLSThrust_conv;
    
% compute the fraction of thrust required to SLS thrust
ThrustFrac = ThrustReq / (c * SLSThrust_conv);

% get the fuel flow
MDotAct = Cff3  * ThrustFrac ^ 3   + ...
          Cff2  * ThrustFrac ^ 2   + ...
          Cff1  * ThrustFrac       + ...
          Cffch * ThrustReq  * Alt ;

% compute the TSFC (convert thrust from kN to N)
TSFC     = MDotAct / (ThrustReq * 1000);


%% FORMULATE OUTPUT STRUCTURE %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% remember the fuel flow
OffOutputs.Fuel = MDotAct;

% remember the thrust output (convert to N from kN)
OffOutputs.Thrust = ThrustReq * 1000;

% remember the TSFCs (in both units)
OffOutputs.TSFC          =                            TSFC              ;
OffOutputs.TSFC_Imperial = UnitConversionPkg.ConvTSFC(TSFC, "SI", "Imp");
OffOutputs.C             =                               c              ;
