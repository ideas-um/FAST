% Evaluate the takeoff segment. Assume maximum thrust/power from all
% components in the propulsion system. In the detailed takeoff segment, the
% time to complete the takeoff roll is computed from the physics (unlike
% the less detailed takeoff segment, EvalTakeoff, which assumes a
% one-minute takeoff).
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft being flown.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft flown after takeoff with the mission history
%                updated in "Aircraft.Mission.History.SI".

% acceleration to determine the time to travel between the respective
% control points as well as the distance between the control points.
