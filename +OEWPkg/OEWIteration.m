%
% This function takes the aircraft specification structure and performs
% regressions (using the regression package) based on the data in the
% IDEAS_DB.mat file to predict the OEW of an aircraft during the sizing
% process. The function uses the calculated OEW to update the MTOW and uses
% the MTOW to size the wing area based on the user input wing loading.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure defining the aircraft specifications.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []

%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure defining the aircraft specifications. This
%                structure has been modified by the original version to
%                have an updated OEW, MTOW, component weights, sea-level
%                static thrust or power, and wing area.
