% Optimize electric motor power code on an off-design mission for a
% parallel-hybrid propulsion architecture.
% The optimzer used is the built in fmincon with the interior point method.
% See setup below to change optimizer paramteters.

%
% INPUTS: 
%   Aircraft - Aircraft struct with desired power code starting values and 
%              desired mission conditions. 
% OUTPUTS:
%   OptAircraft - optimized aircraft struct with optimial power code
