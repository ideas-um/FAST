% Given a propulsion architecture, identify any parallel electric motor /
% engine connections. These connections are used to reduce the power
% supplied by an engine to turn the fan/propeller.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure containing information about the aircraft and
%                its propulsion architecture from
%                "Aircraft.Specs.Propulsion.PropArch".
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure identifying the companion engines / electric
%                motors that are arranged in parallel.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
