%
% Re-compute the operational power splits for a "full throttle" setting
% during the mission.
%
% WARNING: this function only works for two elements connected in parallel
% right now (or conventional/electric architectures that don't have any
% power splits).
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure with information about the aircraft and mission
%                being flown.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
%     SegBeg   - beginning segment index.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / int / []
%
%     SegEnd   - ending segment index.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / int / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - structure with the updated power splits. Only LamTSPS is
%                updated for now.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
