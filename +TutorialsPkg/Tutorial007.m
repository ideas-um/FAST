% This is a tutorial for creating a new propulsion architecture and storing
% it in an aircraft structure. Hard-coded power splits are provided for
% instructional purposes. See the following variables to specify the power
% splits as a function of segment (takeoff, climb, cruise, descent landing)
% and for sizing (SLS):
% 
%     a) Specs.Power.LamTS
%     b) Specs.Power.LamTSPS
%     c) Specs.Power.LamPSPS
%     d) Specs.Power.LamPSES
%
% INPUTS:
%     none
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft structure with updated propulsion architecture.
%                type/size/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
