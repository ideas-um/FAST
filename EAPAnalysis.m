% For a given aircraft, either:
%
%     (1) perform sizing (an on-design analysis) by iterating over its
%     MTOW, block fuel, battery weight, electric generator weight, and
%     electric motor weight.
%
%     (2) assess its performance (an off-design analysis) by flying a
%     specified mission consisting of takeoff, climb, and cruise segments.
%
% INPUTS:
%     Aircraft - aircraft structure for aircraft to be analyzed.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / struct / []
%
%     Type     - analysis type, which can be either:
%                    a) +1, on -design analysis (sizing + performance).
%                    b) -1, off-design analysis (         performance).
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / int / []
%
%     MaxIter  - maximum iterations during sizing.
%                size/type/units: 1-by-1 / int / []
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     Aircraft - updated aircraft structure.
